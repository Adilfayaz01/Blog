Python is renowned for its clean and readable syntax, making it an excellent choice for beginners and professionals alike. Unlike many other programming languages, Python uses indentation to define code blocks, which enforces good coding practices and improves code clarity. For example, instead of using braces or keywords, Python relies on whitespace:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

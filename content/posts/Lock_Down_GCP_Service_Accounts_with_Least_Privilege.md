## Introduction: Overprivileged Accounts Are a Hidden Risk

In Google Cloud, service accounts are the backbone of automation, enabling applications and scripts to interact securely with cloud resources. But when a service account has **more privileges than necessary**, it becomes a ticking time bomb a single compromised account can lead to data leaks, resource misuse, or lateral movement across your cloud environment.

This post dives into **how to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) for Google Cloud service accounts**, with actionable examples and best practices that even experienced cloud architects will find indispensable.

## Understand Your Service Accounts: Inventory Before Action

Before you can lock down privileges, you need to know what exists. Start by listing all service accounts in your project:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts list --project PROJECT_ID
```

Document their roles, usage patterns, and dependencies. Avoid making assumptions; **a service account might be powering a production app or a rarely used script**. Tools like **Cloud Asset Inventory** can help you map which accounts access which resources, giving you a clear picture of potential overprivilege.

## Apply Least Privilege: Only Grant What’s Needed

Once you have an inventory, the next step is **role assignment hygiene**:

1. **Use Predefined Roles Instead of Owner**  
    Avoid giving roles like `roles/editor` or `roles/owner` unless absolutely necessary. Instead, choose the **least-privileged predefined role** that allows the service account to perform its tasks. For example:
    

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:my-service-account@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/storage.objectViewer"
```

2. **Create Custom Roles When Needed**  
    If no predefined role fits, create a **custom role** with only the exact permissions your workload requires:
    

```bash
gcloud iam roles create CustomStorageViewer \
  --project=PROJECT_ID \
  --permissions="storage.objects.get,storage.objects.list" \
  --title="Custom Storage Viewer"
```

3. **Follow the Principle of Temporary Privileges**  
    Whenever possible, assign **short-lived credentials** using Workload Identity Federation or impersonation:
    

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
  --iam-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
```

Rotate keys frequently and remove old ones immediately.

## Audit and Monitor Service Accounts Continuously

Implementing PoLP isn’t a one-time effort. Continuous auditing ensures that privileges don’t creep back over time:

- **Enable Cloud Audit Logs** for all service accounts to track which resources are accessed.
    
- **Set up alerts** for unusual privilege escalations or API calls.
    
- **Use Access Transparency and Access Approval** for sensitive projects.
    
Automation can help tools like **GCP Security Command Center** provide automated checks against overprivileged accounts.

## Decommission Unused Service Accounts

Every service account that isn’t actively used is a **security liability**. Regularly review and delete or disable accounts no longer needed:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts delete my-unused-sa@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Maintain a **decommissioning policy** so that orphaned accounts don’t accumulate silently.

## Conclusion: Least Privilege Isn’t Optional

Overprivileged service accounts are a silent vulnerability in any Google Cloud environment. By maintaining an **inventory, assigning least-privileged roles, monitoring continuously, and decommissioning unused accounts**, you drastically reduce your attack surface and enforce security hygiene at scale.

**Question for Readers:** How do you currently enforce least privilege for service accounts in your environment, and what challenges have you faced?
